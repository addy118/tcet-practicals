1. append the original bit for padding.
2. in this way you need to calculate length mod64.
3. most of the cases 64 bits is obtained as answer so append 64 bit in that.
4. A = a, B = b, C = c, D = d.
5. divide 512 bit blocks into 16 blocks each having 32 bits. in that 4 rounds are performed by using 16 sub-blocks and constant k.
